      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Coach Kabir — a clarity coach, growth strategist, and accountability partner dedicated to unlocking your highest potential. With over 8 years of experience in leadership development, psychology, and business strategy, I empower ambitious individuals and teams to breakthrough limiting beliefs and design a future they truly want.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach combines cognitive behavioral techniques, emotional intelligence training, and practical goal-setting frameworks to create a sustainable, values-driven path to success. I believe that every person has the power to transform their mindset and circumstances, with the right guidance and discipline.
      </p>
